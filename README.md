This is my ReadMe file.  I created it on the github page.  I cloned the repository on my local machine, made a change(all this stuff) and then did a git add, a git commit, and a git push, which updated the remote repository with my change.

I created the styles.css on my local machine, then used the same process to upload it to the remote repository.
